# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

Description:
This is the back-end part of my project to the "What To Wear" browser. This takes care of api requests and how to take care of different types of errors and how to display them. How to account for each one and display that for the user. Also, it takes care of how to find "cards" (in this matter) by id and either update, remove, or even posting it to the server.
